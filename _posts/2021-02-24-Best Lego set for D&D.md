# Best *Lego* set for *Dungeons & Dragons*

I spent quiet some time to find a decent *Lego* starter sets for building scenes of our party's *Dungeons & Dragons* adventures. 

Before everybody is going to yell because of misusage of brand names: I'll use *Lego* for all kinds of bricks that are compatible with the original *Lego* bricks from *The Lego Group*. The same goes for *Dungeons & Dragons*, it basically doesn't matter what company's game and rules you are playing. If you or your DM need some support for your world building and story telling, feel free to read on.

## Setting

Our story's main setting is based in a fantasy world. So I was looking for castle, medieval, nature and dungeon themed *Lego* sets. Unfortunately *The Lego Group* thinks, kids these days don't like castles and some medieval adventurers anymore. There were some licensed sets from *The Lord of the Rings* and the old *Castle* series but I missed my opportunity in history and these old sets are only getting more and more expensive. There is this recent *IDEAS* set [#21325](https://www.Lego.com/en-us/product/medieval-blacksmith-21325) which is very nice. Perhaps we'll see more medieval themed *Lego* set in the future.

In general I found that original *Lego* sets and the current direction *The Lego Group* is taking, is neither compatible with my goals nor my wallet. So I searched on.

## Alternatives

Since the initial *Lego* [patent](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a7/70/0c/197bc84bc9afaf/US3005282.pdf) expired there were other companies out there to fill the void and offer alternatives. Initially most of these bricks were of bad quality and just increased the amount of plastic to pollute our oceans. Over the time though these alternative bricks became of decent quality and were reasonably priced. One company I found really interesting is *Blue Brixx*. They focus their sets on adults and more serious builders and less on kid's play.

You can check out their website [here](https://www.bluebrixx.com/en/legal_notice). International shipping prices are expensive but if you live in the EU, they are reasonable. There are [many](https://www.bluebrixx.com/en/bluebrixxspecials/101999/Old-water-mill-BlueBrixx-Special) [sets](https://www.bluebrixx.com/en/bluebrixxspecials/102035/The-Golden-Goblet-Inn-BlueBrixx-Special) I [like](https://www.bluebrixx.com/en/bluebrixxspecials/102000/Village-forge-BlueBrixx-Special) and [own](https://www.bluebrixx.com/en/bluebrixxspecials/102159/Sheriffs-Office-BlueBrixx-Special) but the one I really like, and want to show you, is actually not that obvious or easy to find.

## Surprise

There are a lot of offers online to buy *Lego* bricks in bulk. You can find offers all the time on eBay and other sites. *Blue Brixx* currently sells [1.5 kg (3,30 pounds) of architecture bricks for 38‚Ç¨ ($45)](https://www.bluebrixx.com/en//101586/Kiloware-Architektur-II-1-5-Kg-Diverse). 

The bricks are new and have a very good quality, and most importantly, they totally fit my needs for our *Dungeons & Dragons* adventure settings. In total I bought this set 3 times. Every time with the same content (I didn't count every brick but 99% of the bricks are the same).

Let me show you what's inside and discuss some details.

This is what you get in one package:

- primary colors of this set are grey, black and white
- some plates for roofs, elevation of base plates, structures, ...
- big and medium sized bricks for structural work, perfect for building pillars, prisons, dungeon walls or old ruins
- slopes and plates for tiling work
- brick modified and smallish bricks for details and accents in your walls
- minifigure accessories such as hats, tools, weapons (swords, staffs, spears)
- some plants, leafs and brown bricks for vegetation
- other random bricks for whatever you might imagine

You won't find any minifigures or a lot of bricks in primary colors in this set. 
I love the original *Lego* minifigures, the alternatives never resonated with me, so this is fine for me.
If you are looking for colorful bricks, I would highly recommend the original *Lego* sets of the *CLASSIC* line. You'll get some nice random colorful bricks. These are totally fine for building your monsters and to add some color splashes in your dungeons.

## Example MOC

![Temple](/assets/2021-02-24/temple.jpeg)

Well, my example is not as refined as a lot of the MOCs you can see on social media but that is because this was not the goal. I don't want to integrate hundreds of 1x1 bricks, plates and slopes and include super advanced building techniques in one small wall and put my creation in a cabinet forever or to showcase it on Instagram. I want my creations to be played with during our *Dungeons and Dragons* sessions, as a supplement for the GM and the party to support story building.

For this MOC I only used the following *Blue Brixx* sets:

- 2x [base plate (32x32)](https://www.bluebrixx.com/en/accessories/101244/WAN-8806-Dark-Grey-Plate-32x32-Dark-Grey-Wange) - 5‚Ç¨
- 1x [architecture II set 1.5 kg](https://www.bluebrixx.com/en//101586/Kiloware-Architektur-II-1-5-Kg-Diverse) - 38‚Ç¨
- 1x [40 pcs Rock set, Light Bluish Gray](https://www.bluebrixx.com/en/assortments/401148/40-pcs-Rock-set-Light-Bluish-Gray-BlueBrixx-Special) - 30‚Ç¨

There were still a ton of bricks all around my table (especially the small ones that would add a lot of details if you're into that) so a lot of opportunities for new adventures.

## Summary

For less then 100‚Ç¨ you got some decent *Lego* bricks for your next *Dungeons & Dragons* adventures. More bricks and more build time will always yield better results for your MOCs. I really enjoyed this set(s) and wanted to share this with the world. Perhaps someone will read this post and build his or her own adventures.

Have fun üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
